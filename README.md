Experimental extension providing a few shortcodes that you can use to add details about the subscription product where you want them to be. Either to be used in a custom theme for your single product pages or use them to blog about a product you are selling.

These shortcodes are compaitable with [WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things) currently in development.

# Guide

### Requirements

In order to use the extension, you will need:

* WooCommerce 2.3 or newer.
* WooCommerce Subscriptions v2.0 or newer.
* A staging or test site, I do not recommend using this on live sites yet.
* A sense of adventure as the codebase is still beta.

### Installation
To install the Subscription Shortcodes:

1. Download the latest version of the plugin [here](https://github.com/seb86/WooCommerce-Subscription-Shortcodes/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to **Plugins > Add New > Upload** administration screen on your WordPress site
3. Select the ZIP file you just downloaded
4. Click **Install Now**
5. Click **Activate**

After installation, you can use the shortcodes listed below.

### Shortcode Usage

Simply insert the shortcode you wish to use on the product page or blog post or even a standard page. If you use the shortcode outside of the product page then you will need to add the product ID attribute or the sku ID attribute.

> Example: `[subscription_price id="123"]` or `[subscription_price sku="123"]`

##### Subscription Price
Returns the current price of the subscription along with the rest of the subscription data in a single string.

Shortcode: `[subscription_price]`

* sign_up_fee: false
* trial_length: false
* before_price: NULL
* after_price: NULL

> This shortcode still requires some work.

##### Subscription Price Meta
This particular shortcode returns the price meta data. If the subscription is on sale, then the price meta returns both the sale price and regular price striked through. Otherwise it will return just the regular price as normal. However you can force it to return what you want only.

> Example: If you only want to display the sale price, simply enter sale as the meta value in the shortcode.

Shortcode: `[subscription_price_meta]`
###### Default Arguments
* meta: both

##### Subscription Period

Shortcode: `[subscription_period]`

Shortcode: `[subscription_period_interval]`

### Other Shortcodes

##### Subscription Discount

Shortcode: `[subscription_discount]`

This shortcode string ending can also be filtered using this filter. `wcs_shortcodes_sub_discount_string`.

### Other Notes
In order to show details for sign up fee, trial length and trial period of a product using [WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things](https://github.com/Prospress/woocommerce-subscribe-all-the-things) you will need to also have [WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things - Sign-up and Trial Add-on](https://github.com/seb86/woocommerce-subscribe-to-all-the-things-signup-trial-add-on) installed.

---

### Filters
Developers can add support for a product type by filtering it in. By default, only `subscription` and `subscription-variation` are supported.

If you have **WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things** mini-extension installed then support for all the product types the extension supports is automatically applied.

Below is an example on how you can filter the supported product types yourself should you need to.

```
/**
 * Add product support for a new product type.
 *
 * @param array $product_types
 * @return array
 */
function add_sub_shortcode_product_support( $product_types ) {
	$product_types[] = 'mix-and-match';

	return $product_types;
}
add_filter( 'wcss_product_types', 'add_sub_shortcode_product_support', 10, 1 );
```
