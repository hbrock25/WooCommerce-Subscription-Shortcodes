#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help me fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/seb86/WooCommerce-Subscription-Shortcodes/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there.
* Submit a report for your issue
  * Clearly describe the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug)
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know that has the issue.
  * Also provide the version of WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions you were using at the time of the issue.

### Making Changes

Making changes to the shortcodes is a key way to help me improve WooCommerce Subscription Shortcodes. You will need some technical skills in PHP to make a change.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. I'll be pleased to get it :)

#### How To Submit A PR

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings please :)
* When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the WooCommerce Subscription Shortcodes repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by me.
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by me.
